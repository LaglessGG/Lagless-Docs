# Benefits of an MTR

Nobody likes a laggy server, and in case of network issues, traceroute analysis will assist us in finding the issue between the 
client (your network) and the server (Lagless infrastructure). From the MTR results, we will be able to determine if the issue 
originates with an Internet Service Provider (ISP), Lagless infrastructure or another internet provider along the route. 
Upon submitting a ticket, we'd ask for this information to better assist with your issues.

<Callout type="info" title="Reference">
  Most MTR outputs look similar or almost the same. For reference, you can use 
  the MTR from Linux to compare with yours if you are using Windows or MacOS

## Installation 

### Windows

We recommend downloading and running WinMTR. Once you unzip the download, you may run the proper executable depending on your system bit (x32 vs x64).

<Card href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/" title="WinMTR Download">
  Download a copy of WinMTR from the SourceForge website.
</Card>

Upon opening the program, you would input your host (IP of Lagless server) and hit start.

### MacOS

You'll need to install Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. Paste this into Terminal and afterwards you can install MTR with the second command.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

brew install mtr
```

### Linux

Depending on your distro of choice, you can use either command. Should you use snap, you can install MTR through that too.

<Tabs items={["Debian/Ubuntu", "CentOS/RHEL", "Snap"]}>
```bash tab
sudo apt-get install mtr
```

```bash tab
sudo yum install mtr
```

```bash tab
sudo snap install mtr
```

</Tabs>

## Output Analysis

If you are using MacOS/Linux, you can run `mtr 23.167.232.1` or your server IP and should receive something similar to this. 

```bash
ams-01 (89.37.98.230) -> 23.167.232.1 (23.167.232.1)                          2025-06-07T21:53:49-0400

From here, this shows that your ISP went through Backbone.Direct to NeoProtect's infrastructure lastly ending at our Dallas network.
In this example, you can see that the latency in Amsterdam is \<1 ms however when the route goes from NeoProtect in Amsterdam to Dallas, that's where the latency jumps.
This is more common because we're traveling overseas. If you are running an MTR from the same region, that latency would be a lot better.
