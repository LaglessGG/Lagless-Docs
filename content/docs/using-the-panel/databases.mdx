# What are Databases?

Databases are used to share data between multiple servers or sub-servers. For instance, you can create a database that allows you to share configurations 
for Dynmap, LuckPerms, WorldGuard and more. At this time, we only support MySQL/MariaDB databases. 

# Creating a Database

Once you are in your server, select on <b>Databases</b> on the left. If you have existing databases, they will automatically be shown here. Otherwise, you can create one.

<b>Name</b>: This name must be unique.
<b>Connection From</b>: You can limit certain IPs from connecting to your database. By default, you can leave it empty to allow all IPs.

# Managing your Database

Once you create your database, you have the options to upload or download the database making snapshots when needed. Select on the eye icon to view your connection details 
which also contains your password. From here, you have all the information you need to plug into your configuration file.

You may also select on <b>Rotate Password</b> in case you think your password is leaked. By doing so, please go back into your configuration files and update the information to avoid interruptions.

# Viewing the database

By downloading a client such as DBeaver or MySQL Workbench, you can enter the connection details to connect and make live changes.
