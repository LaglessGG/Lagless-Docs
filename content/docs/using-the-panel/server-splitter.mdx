# What is a server splitter?

A server splitter is a way to split your resources into "sub-servers" to run other various processes such as discord bots, backend servers, or proxies.

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
  If you choose to upgrade your server specs, additional resources are allocated to your primary server. You can later determine if you need to increase or decrease resources to your other sub-servers.

# Creating Your Splits

Clicking on your primary server, go to <b>Utilities \> Splitter</b>. Here you can see how many splits your server has or is using.

Click the Plus to create a split and fill out the necessary information.

If you want your sub-users from your main server to access the split, make sure to tick <b>Sync Subusers</b>. 
If you have sync’d without adding subusers, you may choose to Sync Subusers later on.

If you have forgotten which server was the main server, go back to the Splitter tab and you'll see it at the top. 
Notice how the footer text has changed. Since we're currently looking at a sub-server, it tells you directly at the footer..

# Updating a Server Split

Should you need to remove a split to free up resources, you can click on the trashcan icon to delete it.
You can always increase or decrease a certain resource, however make sure you select <b>Update Server</b> after making changes, so it will take effect.

Clicking on the <b>Open</b> button, you can go to your sub-server to install or manipulate the resources as you need.
