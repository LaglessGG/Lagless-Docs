## Automatic Backups.

Did you forget to make a backup? No problem, we've got you covered. Lagless makes automatic backups daily.

1. You can find these on the **backups** tab on the left. 
2. From here look for a section named **Automatic Backups**. marked in red.

### Manual backup.

1. Select the tab **Backups** from the left side.
2. Click the **Create Backup** button.

![backup](/images/panel/backups/Backups.png)

3. Name your backup, or leave it empty. In this example we named it my_fabulous_backup.
4. Click **Start backup**

![backup](/images/panel/backups/backup_create.png)

Depending on the size of the backup, it may take a few minutes to complete.
You now have a backup of all files.

## Scheduled backups.

Scheduled backups can be ideal for when you want to plan for it, such as during the night when there are fewer players online. 
Near the end you can find examples of time.

1. To do so, head to the **settings** tab on the left.
2. from here, look for the **Schedules** section.
3. Press **Create Schedule**

4. start by giving your schedule a name something that makes sense to you. For this example we're going to call it **My_scheduled_backup**
<Callout title="Title" type="info">
   You can enable the **Cheatsheet** if you need an example. The tool on this website may also help you [crontab](https://crontab.cronhub.io/)
</Callout>
5. Now we need to tell it when to do the backup. In the example below, it's set to every 12 hours. More about time settings below.

### Schedule time understanding

Understanding what values to enter may seem daunting at first. So let's go over it.
This table shows the possible values

Time - possible values

Minute - 0-59  
Hour - 0-23  
Day of The Month - 1 - 31  
Month - 1-12  
Day of week -  0 - 6, with 0 being Monday, 1 Tuesday etc..  

* Using * Means every **Minute**, **hour**, **Day of month**, **Month**, **Day of week**. Which ever comes first.  
* **/** Means every x hours. So if you were to do */5 in **Minute**, it would do the task every 5 minutes. Or */4 hour, it would do the task every 4 hours.  
* **-** Means it runs at every **Minute**, **hour**, **Day of month**, **Month**, **Day of week** within the range set. For example "* 8-12 * * *"means we run our task at hour "8,9,10,11,12"  
* **,** Means you run it at all values separated by a ",". So if you want to run a task every 15 minutes, you would use "* 15,30,45,0 * * *"  

To give a complex example of all of this

![backup](/images/panel/backups/complex_schedule.png)

This task would run every 15 minutes, between 8:00 and 14:00, if it's day 19 of the month September, but **ONLY** if it's day 1 of the week, which is Monday. If all of these don't align, it will skip till the next year till it does, which isn't until 2033.

### New Task

Now that we have told when to run the schedule, we still need to tell it what to do.

1. Click **New Task**

![backup](/images/panel/backups/Task_new.png)

2. Here we're going to select the action **Create backup**.

3. Press **Create task**

## Filtering backup files

If you don't want to include all files in a backup, there are 2 ways to do this. This method is inspired by .gitignore.

### Manual filtering

During the process of making a manual backup you can use this method.

Typically you would use one of these options. But you can use multiple. Although it's not recommended.


"world" - This will ignore any **file** or **folder** named **world**, anywhere  
"world/" - This will ignore the **folder** named **world**, and anthing inside it  
"world/*" - This will ignore everything in the world folder, the world folder will still be used, just left empty  


![backup](/images/panel/backups/complex_schedule.png)

In this example, I don't want any worlds backed up.

### Automatic filtering

By placing a file named .pteroignore file in your main server directory, you can apply filters to backups made. These apply to all backups, unless stated otherwise.
This works the same as any other text file with the filters mentioned before.
