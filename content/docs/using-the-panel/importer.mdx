## Introduction

Whether you're creating a new server with us, or want to move from another host to us, the server importer allows you to transfer your files with ease.

## How to use the Importer

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to your lagless server on our panel.
</Step>
<Step>
Go to the tab **Importer** on the left.
</Step>
<Step>
Here you will have to enter some information. For our servers, you can find the SFTP information under the **Settings** tab. This may be different with other hosts.
