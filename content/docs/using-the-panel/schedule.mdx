### Example

To restart your server every day at 12.
Create a schedule. Set the time to `minute 0, hour 12, Day of month *, Month *, Day of week *`
Create a task for this schedule and set the action to "send power action" and choose payload "Restart the server".

```
"Send command" is great if you wish to schedule events or send a "/say" command before restart
"Send power action" is commonly used to restart servers.
"Create backup" Is great for a scheduled nighttime backup
```

You can use all of these tasks in a single schedule. But Time offset may be required to delay each task.
