# Fraud-Marked Transactions

**"My payment was declined and marked as fraud - what happened?"**

## Quick Answer

<Callout type="info" title="Short Summary">
**Your payment was blocked for security reasons by either your bank OR Lagless.gg's fraud protection system.** No money was charged and your service wasn't activated. Contact your bank first to authorize the transaction, then retry. If the issue persists, open a support ticket with us.
</Callout>

Transactions can be flagged as fraudulent by two different systems:

1. **Your Bank/Payment Processor** - Automatic fraud detection to protect your account
2. **Lagless.gg** - Our internal fraud protection system to prevent unauthorized purchases

Both systems are designed to protect you from unauthorized charges, but they require different resolution steps.

<Callout type="warn" title="Transaction Blocked for Security">
Regardless of which system blocked your payment, **no money has been charged** and **your service hasn't been activated**. The transaction was blocked before completion to protect your account.
</Callout>

## What Is Fraud Detection?

Fraud detection systems monitor transactions for suspicious patterns that might indicate unauthorized use of your payment method. These systems err on the side of caution to protect your financial accounts.

### Bank Fraud Detection
Your bank or payment processor automatically scans transactions for suspicious activity and blocks potentially fraudulent charges.

### Lagless.gg Fraud Protection
We also have our own fraud protection system that may block transactions based on various risk factors to protect both you and our service.

### Common Fraud Triggers

**Bank/Payment Processor:**
- **Unusual location**: Purchasing from a location different from your normal spending patterns
- **New merchant**: First-time purchases from unfamiliar businesses
- **Large amounts**: Transactions significantly larger than your typical spending
- **International transactions**: Payments to businesses in different countries
- **Rapid purchases**: Multiple payment attempts in quick succession

**Lagless.gg System:**
- **VPN/Proxy usage**: Payment attempts through VPN or proxy connections
- **Suspicious account activity**: New accounts with unusual purchasing patterns
- **High-risk payment methods**: Certain payment types that have higher fraud rates
- **Geographic inconsistencies**: Mismatched billing and IP locations
- **Velocity checks**: Too many payment attempts in a short time period

<Callout type="info" title="Automatic Protection">
Fraud detection is an automatic security feature provided by both banks/payment processors AND Lagless.gg. Both systems are designed to protect you from unauthorized transactions.
</Callout>

## What Happened to Your Payment?

When a transaction is flagged as fraud, here's the typical sequence of events:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Payment Initiation**
    You attempted to purchase a Lagless.gg service using your payment method.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Fraud Detection Activated**
    Either your bank's fraud detection system OR Lagless.gg's fraud protection system identified the transaction as potentially suspicious.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Transaction Blocked**
    The payment was automatically declined and blocked before any money was transferred.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Decline Notification**
    You received an error message indicating the payment was declined or marked as fraud.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Service Not Activated**
    Since no payment was completed, your Lagless.gg service was not activated.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Security Alert**
    You may have received a text message, email, or phone call from your bank about the attempted transaction.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How to Resolve This Issue

### Step 1: Determine Who Blocked the Transaction

**If the error message mentions "fraud" or "security":**
- This is usually a bank/payment processor block
- Follow Steps 2-4 below

**If the error message is from Lagless.gg or mentions our fraud protection:**
- This is our internal system
- Skip to Step 5 (Contact Support)

### Step 2: Contact Your Bank First (For Bank Blocks)

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Call Your Bank"
    icon={<Phone />}
  >
    Contact your bank or credit card company to report that the transaction was legitimate and authorize future payments to Lagless.gg.
  </Card>
  
  <Card
    title="Verify Your Identity"
    icon={<CreditCard />}
  >
    Your bank may ask you to verify your identity and confirm that you attempted to make the purchase.
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Step 3: Authorization Process (For Bank Blocks)

Most banks will ask you to:

1. **Verify the transaction details** (amount, merchant name, date/time)
2. **Confirm your identity** using security questions or codes
3. **Authorize the merchant** (Lagless.gg) for future transactions
4. **Update your account settings** if needed

### Step 4: Retry Your Payment (For Bank Blocks)

<Callout type="warn" title="Wait Before Retrying">
Wait at least 15-30 minutes after speaking with your bank before attempting the payment again. It can take time for authorization changes to take effect.
</Callout>

Once your bank has authorized the transaction:

1. **Clear your browser cache** and cookies
2. **Disable any VPN** connections
3. **Use the same payment method** you discussed with your bank
4. **Try the payment again** on Lagless.gg

### Step 5: Contact Lagless.gg Support (For Our Fraud Protection)

If the transaction was blocked by our fraud protection system:

<Callout type="info">
Please [open a support ticket](https://my.lagless.gg/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=6) immediately. Include:
- The exact error message you received
- Your account email address
- Payment method you were trying to use
- Any VPN or proxy services you were using
</Callout>

## Prevention Tips

To reduce the likelihood of future fraud flags:

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Pre-authorize Gaming Purchases" id="preauth">
Contact your bank to pre-authorize gaming and hosting service purchases. Many banks can add notes to your account about legitimate recurring expenses.

**What to tell your bank**: "I regularly purchase gaming server hosting services online and want to prevent fraud flags on these transactions."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Consistent Payment Methods" id="consistent">
Stick to the same payment method and avoid switching between different cards or payment services frequently.

**Benefits**: Establishes a pattern of legitimate use that fraud detection systems recognize.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Avoid VPN During Payments" id="no-vpn">
Disable VPN connections when making payments, as they can trigger location-based fraud detection.

**Why**: VPNs make it appear you're purchasing from a different location, which can trigger security systems.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keep Bank Information Updated" id="updated-info">
Ensure your bank has your current phone number and email address for fraud alerts and verification.

**Important**: Up-to-date contact information helps banks reach you quickly for transaction verification.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time Customer

**Situation**: You're new to Lagless.gg and your first purchase was flagged.

**Solution**: 
- This is very common for new merchants
- Call your bank to verify the transaction
- Ask them to whitelist Lagless.gg for future purchases
- Retry the payment after authorization

### Scenario 2: International Customer

**Situation**: You're located outside the US and your payment was flagged.

**Solution**:
- International transactions are commonly flagged
- Contact your bank to authorize international online purchases
- Consider using a payment method known to work internationally
- Ensure your billing address matches your bank records

### Scenario 3: Large Purchase Amount

**Situation**: You're purchasing an expensive server package and it was flagged.

**Solution**:
- Large purchases often trigger fraud detection
- Call your bank to authorize the specific amount
- Consider splitting the purchase if possible
- Ask about temporary spending limit increases

## What NOT to Do

<Callout type="error" title="Avoid These Actions">
- **Don't try multiple payment methods rapidly** - this can trigger additional fraud flags
- **Don't use different billing addresses** - stick to your registered bank address
- **Don't ignore bank security alerts** - respond to them promptly
- **Don't assume it's a Lagless.gg error** - the block happens before we see the transaction
</Callout>

## When Fraud Detection Helps

Remember that fraud detection systems are there to protect you:

- **Unauthorized use prevention**: Stops criminals from using stolen card information
- **Account security**: Protects your financial accounts from fraudulent charges
- **Peace of mind**: Provides an extra layer of security for online transactions
- **Quick resolution**: Most legitimate transactions can be authorized quickly

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Why was my payment marked as fraud?" id="why-fraud">
Fraud detection systems use various factors including location, purchase patterns, and merchant history to identify potentially suspicious transactions. Your payment likely triggered one or more of these security measures.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will this happen every time I try to pay?" id="every-time">
Usually no. Once you've authorized Lagless.gg with your bank and established a payment history, future transactions are less likely to be flagged.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can Lagless.gg fix this for me?" id="lagless-fix">
It depends on who blocked the transaction. If your bank blocked it, you need to contact them directly. If our fraud protection system blocked it, please open a support ticket and we can review and potentially resolve the issue.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long does bank authorization take?" id="auth-time">
Bank authorization is usually immediate, but it can take 15-30 minutes for the changes to propagate through their systems. Some banks may take up to a few hours.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my bank won't authorize the transaction?" id="bank-refuses">
If your bank is unwilling to authorize the transaction, consider using a different payment method, or contact us via support ticket to discuss alternative payment options.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>
