## Introduction

Using the default port, like Minecraft's 25565 or bedrocks 19132 is primarily about convenience.
Players can connect with just the IP without having to enter the port on java. Or with bedrock, it's automatically entered as default.

This can be great help, as you don't have to support each player when they can't connect with the default port. It just works.
