# What Does "Pending" Mean on My Service?

"Pending" can mean various things on your order. If your order remains as "Pending" for over ten minutes, please consider the following:

## Common Reasons for Pending Status

### 1. Unpaid Invoice
Your invoice for the order might not be paid. Check your invoices - if it is marked as "Unpaid" and you have paid, please open a billing ticket.

### 2. Server Setup in Progress
If your invoice is marked as paid, it could take a few minutes for the server to set up.

### 3. Node Capacity
If it's been a few minutes and the invoice is paid, then our nodes are full (we never oversell our servers) - we will add a new node and then your order will carry on as usual.
