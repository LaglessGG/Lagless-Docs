# Payment Method Removal

You can remove a payment method from your account under certain conditions. This guide explains when and how you can remove payment methods.

## When You Can Remove a Payment Method

You can remove a payment method from your account if **one** of the following conditions is met:

✅ No Active Services
If you have no active services on your account, you can remove any payment method without restrictions.

✅ Multiple Payment Methods Available
If you have multiple payment methods on your account, you can remove one as long as at least one other payment method remains active.

## When You Cannot Remove a Payment Method

You **cannot** remove a payment method if:

❌ You have an active service on your account **AND** the payment method you want to remove is the only payment method on your account.

This restriction ensures that your active services continue to have a valid payment method for billing purposes.

## How to Remove a Payment Method

1. Log in to your [Client Area](https://my.lagless.gg/)
2. Navigate to **Billing** → **Payment Methods**
3. Find the payment method you want to remove
4. Click **Remove** or **Delete**
5. Confirm the removal when prompted

## Alternative Options

If you cannot remove a payment method due to having an active service:

### Add a New Payment Method First
1. Add a new payment method to your account
2. Once the new payment method is verified, you can then remove the old one

### Cancel Your Service
1. [Cancel your active service](/billing/cancel)
2. Once the service is cancelled, you can remove the payment method
