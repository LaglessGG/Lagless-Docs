# Minecraft Server Properties

This guide walks through the most commonly changed settings in `server.properties` for Minecraft servers hosted on Lagless. We'll cover how to change max players, world type, seed, render distance, `motd`, `level-type`, and a few other useful properties.

</Steps>

## Common Properties

### max-players

Controls the maximum number of concurrent players allowed on the server.

Example:
```
max-players=20
```

- Increase this if you expect more players, but ensure the server has enough resources. Lowering it can help reduce load.

### motd

The message-of-the-day shown in the server list.

Example:
```
motd=Welcome to our Lagless Server!
```

Tips:
- Keep it short and descriptive
- Avoid special characters that the client might not render

### level-type

Controls the world generator type. Common values:
- `default` — Standard world
- `flat` — Superflat
- `largeBiomes` — Larger biomes
- `amplified` — Amplified terrain

Example:
```
level-type=default
```

### level-seed

Sets the world seed used by the world generator. Use this to reproduce a specific world.

Example:
```
level-seed=1234567890
```

Tips:
- Seeds can be strings or numbers
- If empty, a random seed will be generated on world creation

### view-distance (render distance)

Controls how many chunks away the server will send to players. Higher values increase visibility but add CPU/memory and network cost.

Example:
```
view-distance=10
```

Recommendations:
- For small servers (up to 10 players): `8-10`
- For larger servers: monitor performance and adjust accordingly

### difficulty

Sets the game difficulty. Options: `peaceful`, `easy`, `normal`, `hard`.

Example:
```
difficulty=normal
```

### gamemode

Sets the default game mode for new players. Options: `survival`, `creative`, `adventure`, `spectator`.

Example:
```
gamemode=survival
```

### allow-flight

Allows players to fly (useful for mods/plugins or creative play). Set to `true` or `false`.

Example:
```
allow-flight=false
```

### spawn-protection

Protects an area around the spawn point from build/destroy actions by non-ops.

Example:
```
spawn-protection=16
```

### enable-command-block

Enable command blocks on the server. Set to `true` or `false`.

Example:
```
enable-command-block=false
```

## Advanced Options

- `max-tick-time` — Controls watchdog settings for server stalls
- `resource-pack` / `resource-pack-sha1` — Force a resource pack on players
- `query.port` and `query.enable` — Enable server query

Only change advanced options if you understand the impact — incorrect values may make the server unstable.
