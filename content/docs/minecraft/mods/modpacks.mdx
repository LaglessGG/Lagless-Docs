# Uploading a Modpack

If you have a modpack that isn't available on any of our providers or are using a custom modpack to play with friends, you'll need to upload it via SFTP.

<Card href="/using-the-panel/sftp" title="SFTP Clients">
  Read our existing guide on how to connect and upload your server with SFTP.
</Card>

After uploading your zipped modpack, navigate to the <b>File Manager</b>, click on the uploaded file, and select <b>Unarchive</b>.

<Callout type="warn" title="Custom Modpacks">
    Use custom modpacks at your own risk. Ensure you've done proper research and are
    using compatible mods—otherwise, you may encounter server issues, client-side problems, or crashes.
