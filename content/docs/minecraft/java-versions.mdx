title: Java Version Compatibility
description: Which Java version to use for your Minecraft server based on the server version.
---

## Overview

When installing or upgrading a Minecraft server, one of the most important parameters to configure correctly is the Java version. Using the wrong Java version will prevent your server from starting.

<Callout type="info">
The "Java version" refers to the underlying Java runtime environment, not the "Java Edition" of Minecraft. This only applies to Java Edition servers - Bedrock Edition does not use Java.
</Callout>

## Compatibility Table

| Server Version | Java Version |
|----------------|--------------|
| 1.16.5 & older | Java 8 |
| 1.17 - 1.17.1 | Java 16 |
| 1.18 - 1.20.4 | Java 17 |
| 1.20.5 + | Java 21 |

## Important Notes

- **Always use the correct Java version** - Your server will not start with an incompatible version
- **Newer Java versions** generally won't work with older Minecraft versions
- **On Lagless hosting**, the Java version is automatically configured based on your server version selection
- **For modded servers**, check your mod loader's requirements as they may have specific Java version needs

## Quick Reference

- **Most current servers (1.20.5+)**: Use Java 21
- **Popular versions (1.18-1.20.4)**: Use Java 17  
- **Legacy servers (1.16.5 and older)**: Use Java 8
