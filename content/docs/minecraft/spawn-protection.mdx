description: Spawn protection prevents players from building around world spawn, undoing any attempts at placing or breaking blocks.

## Introduction

Spawn protection only exists in dedicated servers and does not apply in singleplayer worlds or LAN worlds. Spawn protection only applies in the Overworld, since the world spawn is always in the Overworld.
Spawn protection may be a useful feature for servers to prevent players from griefing the spawn area. You may want to disable it or change its range for a private server or a specific world design.
