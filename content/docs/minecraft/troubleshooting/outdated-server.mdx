# Steps to installing a newer version

## 1. Login and select your server

## 2. Pick Version Selector
Depending on the device, you may need to scroll down to see <b>Versions</b>
under the Minecraft category. This section will also tell you the current version and build
your server is running and if you are running an outdated build.

You can pick any version but in this example, we'll be using Fabric.

## 3. Install New Server

Now you can pick your version then build. We'll install the latest version and patch
but here you can back track to a specific build in case you are experiencing issues.

<Callout type="warn" title="Backup your files">
    While the Lagless panel does have automatic backups, they may not be the most recent. 
    Make a backup prior to changing your version in case of corruption. 
    Furthermore, if you are starting over, you can disregard this step.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="Wipe Files Option">
    Only select "Wipe Files" if you want to completely start over with a fresh server. 
    This will delete all your existing world data, plugins, and configurations permanently.
</Callout>

You'll also need to tick to agree the EULA.

You can also go to <b>Console</b> on the navigation to view your progress.
