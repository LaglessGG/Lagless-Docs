# Secure profiles

To fix this, open the file manager and go to `server.properties`\

# Disabling chat reporting
<Callout type="info">
**Note:** In 1.19.1, Mojang introduced chat reporting. Some players prefer this feature to be disabled so conversations remain moderated solely by the server rather than by Mojang.
</Callout>
## Steps
1. Download the plugin: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/no-chat-reports.102990/
2. Put the `.jar` file into your `/plugins` folder.
3. Restart the server.

Chat messages are now unreportable and Minecraft chat reporting is effectively disabled.
