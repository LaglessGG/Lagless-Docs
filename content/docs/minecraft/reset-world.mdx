# Backing Up Data

If you'd like to keep your world to restore at a later point, you can zip them and download via File Manager or SFTP.

<Callout type="warn" title="Shutdown Server">
Make sure to shut down your server prior to archiving and downloading your worlds. 
This ensures you have the latest files before wiping everything clean.
</Callout>

## Zipping Files

- On your server, select <b>Files</b> on the left.
- Select the world folders (world, world_nether, world_the_end) and select <b>Archive</b>

Depending on your world size, you may need to wait a few minutes for the worlds to zip.

# Downloading Archive

Now, you can choose to download it directly from the browser or through an SFTP client (such as FileZilla or WinSCP).

Alternatively, you can connect via SFTP. Your SFTP details can be found under the <b>File Manager</b> and picking <b>Launch SFTP</b> from the context menu.

After you downloaded your files, you can delete the world folders and start your server as normal. Be aware that this may take a minute or two as it is generating a new spawn area.

# Different World Names

Depending on if you are using a custom modpack, your world folders may be named something different. To find the 
proper name, go to <b>Files</b> and select your `server.properties` file. You're looking for the `level-name` line.
