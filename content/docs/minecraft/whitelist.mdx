# General Information

Why even whitelist? Nowadays anyone can figure out the IP and port to a server and grief your world. You can whitelist your server, blocking strangers and only letting people you know in.

The commands in this wiki are provided without the `/` (slash) included. If you are executing these commands via Console, the slash is already assumed.
When running the commands as OP in-game, you will need the `/` (slash) to properly execute the commands.

Respectively, Java uses `whitelist` while Bedrock uses `allowlist`. Generally the commands are the same but are provided depending on which server you're running.
