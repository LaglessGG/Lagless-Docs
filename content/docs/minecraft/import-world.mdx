# Zipping Software

We recommend using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> for uploading. Other clients such as Win-Rar may suffice.

# Zipping your World

Select your world under Singleplayer and hit <b>Edit</b>

![import-edit](/images/minecraft/import-edit.png)

Next, you'll select on <b>Open World Folder</b>

![import-open](/images/minecraft/import-open.png)

From here, you'll see your world folder. Now, select everything and hit <b>Add to .zip</b>

![zip-world](/images/minecraft/zip-world.png)

Depending on your world size, it may take some time. Once it's complete, you'll see a new zip file in that same folder 
containing your world.

# Uploading to Lagless

<Callout type="info" title="Before you start">
    If you already have a world file, remember to delete it before uploading. If you are starting from scratch, you can skip this step.
</Callout>

We recommend using an SFTP client such as WinSCP or FileZilla. 

To launch an SFTP session, go to <b>Files</b> and click on <b>Launch SFTP</b>.

Create a folder, we recommend naming it `world`. Remember if you choose to name it something else, you will need to change `world-name` in `server.properties`

![create-folder](/images/minecraft/create-folder.png)

Enter the folder you just created, then drag and drop your file over. Depending on your internet speed, this may take some time.

# Unzipping

Finally, go back to your File Manager and unzip the world.

You can delete the zipped folder uploaded previously. Now, you can start your server and play with friends.
