# What is LuckPerms?

LuckPerms is a plugin that manages permissions to certain groups across multiple servers.
You can use LuckPerms to enforce what commands players can use.

# Installing Plugin

Find Luckperms under <b>Plugins</b> and select on download.

![luckperms-search](/images/minecraft/luckperms/search.png)

Depending on your what version of Minecraft is running, you may need to switch plugin versions.
For this example, I'm using Velocity so I'll install <b>v5.5.0 (Velocity)</b>. After selecting the version, you can select <b>Install Plugin</b>

![luckperms-install](/images/minecraft/luckperms/install.png)

Make sure to install the plugin on every server you intend to enforce permissions across.

### Verify it's working

To confirm LuckPerms is running, start your server.
You should see log entries similar to the output below, confirming the plugin loaded successfully.

```bash
container@pterodactyl~ java -Dterminal.jline=false -Dterminal.ansi=true -Xms256M -Xmx7372M -jar server.jar

# Configuring LuckPerms

In <b>File Manager</b>, you can find the config files under <b>plugins/luckperms/</b>

- `config.yml` is your config file for Bukkit, Spigot, etc
- `luckperms.conf` is your config file for Sponge or Fabric

<Callout type="warn" title="Database File">
    When configuring LuckPerms, make sure you <b>DO NOT</b> delete <b>luckperms-h2-v2.mv.db</b>. By default, LuckPerms
    stores its data locally. If you intend on only having one server, you can keep this for your permission data. 
</Callout>

### Local Database Files

By default, Luckperms uses H2. Depending on your preference, you can set `storage-method` in <b>config.yml</b>
to SQLite. If you plan on using H2 or SQLite, modifying data outside Minecraft may be harder since you'll need a program
that can read the data. 

If you want to read and edit quicker, you can use `yaml`, `json`, `hocon`, or `toml` based on your preference.

Remember that these options are better if you only have one server. Do not use any of these options if you are running more servers.

### Switching to MariaDB/MySQL

Planning on running multiple servers? You can setup LuckPerms to run with MySQL so you can sync data back and forth.

<Card href="/using-the-panel/databases" title="Databases">

</Card>

Once you create your database, copy the information and plug into the config file as so. After filling in your information, your file should look similar to ours.

```yml
storage-method: mariadb

# The following block defines the settings for remote database storage methods.
#
# - You don't need to touch any of the settings here if you're using a local storage method!
# - The connection detail options are shared between all remote storage types.

data:

  # Define the address and port for the database.
  # - The standard DB engine port is used by default
  #   (MySQL: 3306, PostgreSQL: 5432, MongoDB: 27017)
  # - Specify as "host:port" if differs
  address: cantura.stelhosting.com:3306

  # The name of the database to store LuckPerms data in.
  # - This must be created already. Don't worry about this setting if you're using MongoDB.
  database: s327_luckperms

  # Credentials for the database.
  username: u327_2wFDR152FG
  password: 'RMUJH+kjXEWzFpL4EU.1=q5W'
```

Save your file and then restart. When looking at your console, it should say `SQL` instead of `H2`

```bash

[04:55:44 INFO]: Done (1.18s)!
```

Repeat this for as many servers you have. Remember, you only need <b>one</b> database to share across all your servers.

# Debugging

If you get an error similar to this:

```bash
[04:54:56 WARN] [me.lucko.luckperms.lib.mariadb.message.server.ErrorPacket]: Error: 1045-28000: Access denied for user 'u327_2wFDR152FG'@'23.129.100.66' (using password: YES)
```
Go back and make sure your database password is the same as whats in the config.

After selecting the eye icon, your password along with the rest of your connection information is there.
