## Plugin Configuration

### Basic Config Setup

1. **Stop Your Server** (if running)

2. **Edit the Config**
   - In the Lagless Panel, go to **Files** > `plugins` > `DiscordSRV`
   - Open `config.yml`

3. **Add Your Bot Token**
   Find this line and replace `BOTTOKEN` with your actual bot token:
   ```yaml
   BotToken: "BOTTOKEN"
   ```

4. **Set Your Channel ID**
   - In Discord, right-click your desired channel and "Copy ID"
   - Find this section and replace the channel ID:
   ```yaml
   Channels: {"global": "000000000000000000"}
   ```

### Getting Discord Channel IDs

<Callout type="info">
To copy Discord channel IDs, you need Developer Mode enabled in Discord. Go to User Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode and turn it on.
</Callout>

1. Right-click the channel you want to use
2. Select "Copy ID"
3. Paste this ID in your DiscordSRV config

### Important Config Options

Here are some key settings you might want to adjust:

```yaml
# Allow Discord users to run commands
DiscordChatChannelAllowedCommands: ["say", "me"]

# Require players to link their accounts
RequireLinkedAccount: false

# Format for messages from Discord to Minecraft
DiscordToMinecraftChatMessageFormat: "&b[Discord] %name%&r: %message%"

# Format for messages from Minecraft to Discord
MinecraftChatToDiscordMessageFormat: "**%displayname%**: %message%"
```

## Testing the Setup

1. **Start Your Server**
   - After saving your config changes, start the server

2. **Check the Console**
   - Look for DiscordSRV connection messages
   - You should see "DiscordSRV has connected to Discord"

3. **Test Chat Integration**
   - Send a message in your Minecraft server
   - It should appear in your Discord channel
   - Send a message in Discord and it should appear in Minecraft

## Common Issues

### Bot Won't Connect

- Double-check your bot token is correct
- Make sure the bot has proper permissions
- Verify the bot is in your Discord server

### Messages Not Syncing

- Confirm your channel ID is correct
- Check that the bot can read/send messages in that channel
- Make sure you've restarted the server after config changes

### Permission Errors

- Ensure your Discord bot has the required permissions
- Check that the channel isn't restricted to certain roles

## Advanced Features

### Account Linking

Players can link their Minecraft and Discord accounts using:
```
/discord link
```

This will provide them with a code to DM to the bot for verification.

### Console Integration

You can set up console command integration to run Minecraft commands from Discord. Edit these sections in your config:

```yaml
DiscordConsoleChannelId: "000000000000000000"
DiscordConsoleChannelUsageLog: true
```

### Custom Messages

DiscordSRV supports custom messages for join/leave events, deaths, achievements, and more. Check the `messages.yml` file for all available options.

## Conclusion

DiscordSRV is a powerful way to connect your Minecraft community with Discord. Once set up properly, it creates a seamless chat experience between platforms and can help grow your server community.
