title: How to Install Geyser and Floodgate
description: Your step by step way of installing Geyser and Floodgate
---

## Introduction

First some important notes regarding this.

- With **Geyser** alone, a Bedrock player must have a valid, paid **Java Edition account** to authenticate and join.
- With **Geyser + Floodgate**, Bedrock players can join **without a Java account.** This is required for console players (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch) and is ideal for easier access.

### Versions
You can use Geyser-Spigot on servers that run on 1.16.5 or above. Do note that Geyser requires Java 17 to run!

### chat signing
In order for Bedrock players to chat (1.19.3+) or join (1.19.1/1.19.2), you need to disable chat signing.

Vanilla, Spigot/Paper/forks, Fabric, NeoForge
```yaml
Set enforce-secure-profile: false in server.properties
```
BungeeCord and forks
```yaml
Set enforce_secure_profile: false in config.yml
```

Velocity
```yaml
Set force-key-authentication = false in velocity.toml
```

### Viaversion

Due to Bedrock automatically updating clients, [Via Version](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/) is heavily recommended.  
If this is not used. Bedrock users with a later version than the server won't be able to connect. Updating a plugin is also easier than the whole server.

## Installing on a Server(Spigot/Paper)

<Steps>
    <Step>
	Login to your game panel and navigate to the **Network** tab. Check your list of allocations.
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Your server is already using an assigned port. We can use this. You need to find one additional port for Bedrock players.
	
	If you do **HAVE** dedicated ports (25565, 19132) you can move to the next step.
	If you do **NOT** have dedicated ports, Find one free port in your allocation list for Bedrock players. If none are free, click **Create Allocation** to add a new port. Remember this port number.

    </Step>
    <Step>
	Navigate to the **Templates** tab on the left.
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Select **GeyserMC** 
    </Step>
	<Step>
	Make sure **Include Floodgate** is selected. (it's enabled by default)
	</Step>
    <Step>
	Select **GeyserMC Type** by default this is spigot and works on all forks.
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Select the **Bedrock Port** you assigned earlier from the list.
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Press **Install** and click **Okay** on the new window that appears.
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Go to the files tab and to this file **/plugins/Geyser-Spigot/config.yml** and change your java port if it's not 25565. We selected the bedrock port before.
    </Step>
</Steps>

```yaml
remote:
  # The IP address of the remote (Java Edition) server
  # If it is "auto", for standalone version the remote address will be set to 127.0.0.1,
  # for plugin versions, it is recommended to keep this as "auto" so Geyser will automatically configure address, port, and auth-type.
  # Leave as "auto" if floodgate is installed.
  address: auto
  # The port of the remote (Java Edition) server
  # For plugin versions, if address has been set to "auto", the port will also follow the server's listening port.
  port: 25575
```

### Installing on a Server(Spigot/Paper) manually.

<Steps>
    <Step>
	Download [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/download?project=geyser) and [Floodgate](https://geysermc.org/download?project=floodgate) Pay attention to which version you download. Typically you want the **Spigot/Paper** version.
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Navigate to the **Files** tab and go to the plugin folder. From here, drag the plugins you just downloaded onto the panel. You can also upload via SFTP
	![drag-and-drop](/images/minecraft/geyser/drag-and-drop.gif)
    </Step>
    <Step>
	wait for the upload to complete.
	![uploading](/images/minecraft/geyser/uploading.png)
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Restart the server.
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Then go to this file **/plugins/Geyser-Spigot/config.yml** and change your bedrock and java port if it's different from default.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Installing on a Proxy(Velocity)

<Steps>
    <Step>
	Login to your game panel and navigate to the **Network** tab
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Your proxy is already using an assigned port. We can use this. You need to find one additional port for Bedrock players.
	
	If you do **HAVE** dedicated ports (25565, 19132) you can move to the next step.
	If you do **NOT** have dedicated ports, Find one free port in your allocation list for Bedrock players. If none are free, click **Create Allocation** to add a new port. Remember this port number.
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Navigate to the **Templates** tab on the left.
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Select **GeyserMC** 
    </Step>
	<Step>
	Make sure **Include Floodgate** is selected. (it's enabled by default)
	</Step>
    <Step>
	Select **GeyserMC Type** by default this is spigot, change this to velocity.
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Select the **Bedrock Port** you assigned earlier from the list.
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Press **Install** and click **Okay** on the new window that appears.
    </Step>
    <Step>
	Go to the files tab and to this file **/plugins/Geyser-velocity/config.yml** and change your java port if it's not 25565. We selected the bedrock port before.
    </Step>
</Steps>

</Steps>

<Callout>
Install Geyser only on the proxy server! You can install Floodgate on all servers for better skin support & network-wide Floodgate API availability for other plugins.
All servers on the network must accept 1.21.7-1.21.8 Java clients, as Geyser imitates one.
