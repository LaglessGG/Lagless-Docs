# Getting Started
Under your server, go to <b>Plugins</b> and select the Install button for <i>Simple Voice Chat</i> mod.

![voicechat-plugins](/images/minecraft/voicechat/plugins.png)

Select the build and <b>Install Plugin</b>

![voicechat-install](/images/minecraft/voicechat/install.png)

# Configuring the plugin

You'll need to create a new allocation under <b>Network</b> and use that port for the plugin to work accordingly.

![voicechat-allocation](/images/allocations/page.png)

<Callout type="warn">
  Make sure to only select <b>Create Allocation</b> and NOT <b>Make Primary</b>. Using the same port for Minecraft and the plugin will 
  cause issues.
</Callout>

Next, go into <b>Files</b> and find your config file.

<Tabs items={["Fabric/NeoForge/Forge/Quilt", "Bukkit/Spigot/Paper"]}>
```bash tab
config/voicechat/voicechat-server.properties
```

```bash tab
plugins/voicechat/voicechat-server.properties
```

</Tabs>

Anything within the selection is customizable, however make sure to change the port to the allocation you created earlier. 

```bash
# Simple Voice Chat server config v2.5.32

# The port number to use for the voice chat communication.
# Audio packets are always transmitted via the UDP protocol on the port number
# specified here, independently of other networking used for the game server.
# Set this to '-1' to use the same port number that is used by the Minecraft server.
# However, it is strongly recommended NOT to use the same port number because UDP on
# it is also used by default for the server query. Doing so may crash the server!
port=50127
```

Afterwards, restart your server and make sure the plugin is running on the right port.
