description: Your step-by-step guide to using Chunky to pregenerate a world
---

## Getting Started

Install Chunky on your server by downloading either the [plugin](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chunky/versions?l=bukkit&l=paper&l=spigot) or [mod](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chunky/versions?l=fabric&l=neoforge&l=forge) and dragging & dropping the file into your server's `plugins` or `mods` folder. You can use an SFTP client or the **Plugins**/**Mods** tab in your game panel to do this.

<Callout type="info" title="info">
  Even though you would ideally generate each world, be mindful that 1 block in the nether is 8 in the overworld.
  Because of this players can get outside of the worldborder if you make them the same size. So make the overworld 8 times bigger to not have this happen.
</Callout>

### Configuring Chunky

<Steps>
<Step>
**Enable Continue-on-Restart (Recommended)**

Chunky can use a lot of RAM and may require server restarts. To ensure your pregeneration continues after a restart, navigate to `/plugins/Chunky/config.yml` and change the setting from `continue-on-restart: false` to `continue-on-restart: true`. You typically won't need to change anything else in this file.
</Step>
<Step>
**Verify Your Permissions**

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to use Chunky's commands. The simplest method is to give yourself operator (OP) status using the console or an in-game command.

```bash
op snowman_sir
[11:06:26 INFO]: Made snowman_sir a server operator
```  
If you are using a permissions plugin like LuckPerms, you can grant the wildcard permission `chunky.*`.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Using Chunky

<Callout type="info" title="Example">
  The following example uses commands in the server console.  
  You can also run them in-game, which provides autocomplete.  

  It is recommended to pregenerate only one world at a time, especially for modded servers.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
Start by selecting the world you want to pregenerate by using the command `/chunky world world`

```bash
chunky world world
[11:42:29 INFO]: [Chunky] World changed to world.
```  
</Step>
<Step>
**Set a worldborder** using the command `worldborder set 100` for 100 blocks, if you want chunks simply multiply by 16. (since each chunk is 16 blocks)  
**Example**: To pregenerate a 5,000-chunk area, the diameter would be 5,000 * 16 = 80,000.

```bash
worldborder set 100
[11:44:20 INFO]: Set the world border to 100.0 block(s) wide
```  
</Step>
<Step>

Use the command `chunky worldborder` so Chunky knows the world border size and center.
```bash
chunky worldborder
[11:46:17 INFO]: [Chunky] Center changed to -519.5, -365.5.
[11:46:17 INFO]: [Chunky] Radius changed to 50.
```
</Step>
<Step>
The final step, use the command `chunky start`. When it's finished it will tell you and you should no longer see any progress of generating.  
```bash
chunky start
