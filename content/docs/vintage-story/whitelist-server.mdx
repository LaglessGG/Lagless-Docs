## Introduction

This guide will help you set up a whitelist for your Vintage Story server to create a safe and enjoyable multiplayer environment. By only allowing specific players to join, server admins can prevent griefing and other forms of misconduct.

**Note:** The whitelist is enabled by default on Vintage Story 1.20+.

## Prerequisites

- A Vintage Story server hosted on Lagless
- Admin access to your server
- Access to the [Lagless Panel](https://panel.lagless.gg)

## Whitelist Commands

### Console Commands

You can manage your whitelist through the server console in the Lagless Panel:

1. Log in to the [Lagless Panel](https://panel.lagless.gg)
2. Navigate to your Vintage Story server
3. Go to the **Console** tab
4. Enter the desired command

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/whitelist on` | Enables the server whitelist |
| `/whitelist off` | Disables the server whitelist |
| `/whitelist add [playername]` | Adds a player to the whitelist |
| `/whitelist remove [playername]` | Removes a player from the whitelist |

### In-Game Commands

If you're an admin in the game, you can also manage the whitelist from the chat:

1. **Join** the game as an admin
2. From the **chatbox**, enter the desired command

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/player [playername] whitelist add` | Adds the desired player to the whitelist |
| `/player [playername] whitelist remove` | Removes the player from the whitelist |

**Note:** Console commands will also work for admins in-game.
