## Introduction

This guide explains how to assign admin permissions to players on your Vintage Story server. Admins have access to moderation commands for managing the server.

## What Admins Can Do

Admins in Vintage Story have permission to use various commands that help with server moderation, including:

- Kicking and banning players
- Changing game modes
- Teleporting players
- Using cheat commands
- Managing server settings

## Assigning Admin Permissions

You can grant admin permissions using the `op` command through your server's console.

1. **Access your control panel** and navigate to your Vintage Story server.
2. **Start your server** if it's not already running.
3. **Go to the Console** section in your control panel.
4. **Enter the command**: `/op <username>`
   - Replace `<username>` with the exact username of the player you want to make an admin.

5. **Press Enter** to execute the command.

The player will now have admin permissions the next time they join the server.

## Removing Admin Permissions

To remove admin permissions from a player:

1. **Go to the Console** in your control panel.
2. **Enter the command**: `/player <username> role suplayer`
   - Replace `<username>` with the player's exact username.

<Callout type="info">
This command changes the player's role to "suplayer" (super player), which removes their admin privileges. The player will lose admin permissions on their next login.
</Callout>

## Using Admin Commands In-Game

Once a player has admin permissions, they can use commands directly in the game chat by typing them with a `/` prefix.

For a full list of available admin commands, refer to the [Vintage Story Wiki](https://wiki.vintagestory.at/index.php/List_of_server_commands#Commands_for_Moderators_and_Admins).

## Best Practices

- **Grant admin sparingly**: Only give admin permissions to trusted players.
- **Monitor usage**: Keep an eye on server logs for admin command usage.
- **Regular reviews**: Periodically review who has admin access and remove it if needed.
