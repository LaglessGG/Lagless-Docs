# Vintage Story Server Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up your Vintage Story server on Lagless.gg, including version management and initial configuration.

## Changing Game Version

Vintage Story servers default to the **latest version**. If you need a specific version (like 1.20.10 for modpack compatibility):

1. Navigate to your server's **Settings** page
2. Scroll down to find the version settings
3. Enter your desired version (e.g., `1.20.10`)
4. **Important**: Scroll down and click **"Re-install"** to actually change the version
5. Wait for the reinstallation process to complete

  Starting from version 1.21 Vintage Story requires the .net 8 Desktop Runtime, while older requires 7.

### Verifying Your Version

To confirm your server is running the correct version:
1. Start your server
2. Join the game
3. Use the command: `/info created version`
4. This will show you what version the world was created with

## Initial Server Configuration

### Basic Settings

After installing Vintage Story, you'll want to configure basic server settings:

1. Navigate to **File Manager** in your panel
2. Open `serverconfig.json`
3. Configure the following key settings:

```json
{
  "ServerName": "Your Server Name",
  "WelcomeMessage": "Welcome to our server!",
  "MaxClients": 16,
  "Password": "",
  "WorldName": "MyWorld",
  "OnlyWhitelisted": false,
  "AdvertiseServer": false
}
```

#### Server Visibility

To make your server appear on the public server list (so players can find it via the in-game browser), set `"AdvertiseServer": true` in `serverconfig.json`. If you want a private server, set it to `false`.

### World Generation Settings

Configure world generation in the `WorldConfig` section of `serverconfig.json`:

- **WorldType**: `standard` or `creative`
- **WorldSize**: Size of the world (larger = more exploration)
- **MapSizeY**: World height (affects mountain height)

## Starting Your Server

1. **Start the server** from your control panel
2. **Monitor the console** for any startup errors
3. **Check server logs** if issues occur
4. **Test connection** by joining with your client

### First-Time Setup

When starting for the first time:
1. The server will generate a new world (this takes time)
2. Wait for the message "Server started" in console
3. Join the server to test connectivity
4. [Configure admin permissions](/vintage-story/admin-permissions) if needed

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Allocation

For optimal performance:
- **Small servers (1-4 players)**: 2-4GB RAM
- **Medium servers (5-8 players)**: 4-6GB RAM  
- **Large servers (9+ players)**: 6GB+ RAM

### JVM Arguments

Vintage Story runs on .NET, but you can optimize performance through server settings:

```json
{
  "TickTime": 50,
  "MaxChunkRadius": 8,
  "MaxConcurrentSaves": 2
}
```

## Best Practices

### Before Going Live

1. **Test locally** - Verify your configuration works
2. **Set up backups** - Configure automatic backups in the panel
3. **Plan your world** - Decide on world settings before generating
4. **Document settings** - Keep notes on your configuration

### Server Management

1. **Regular restarts** - Schedule daily restarts for stability
2. **Monitor logs** - Watch for errors or warnings
3. **Update carefully** - Test updates on a backup first
4. **Backup frequently** - Use the panel's backup feature

## Common Issues

### Server Won't Start

**Check for:**
- Invalid JSON in `serverconfig.json`
- Insufficient memory allocation
- Port conflicts
- Missing files after version change

### Connection Issues

**Troubleshoot:**
- Verify server is running
- Check firewall settings
- Confirm version compatibility
- Test with different clients

### Performance Problems

**Solutions:**
- Reduce max chunk radius
- Lower max concurrent players
- Increase memory allocation
- Check for resource-heavy mods

## Getting Help

1. **Check server logs** - Look for specific error messages
2. **Join our Discord** - Get help from staff and community
3. **Contact support** - Open a ticket with your Support ID
4. **Include details** - Provide logs, error messages, and reproduction steps
